This code is a PHP script that defines a `Rating` class which extends an `App` class. The `Rating` class represents a rating given by a judge to a team based on a certain criterion. The class contains methods for finding, storing, and retrieving ratings from a database.

The class has several properties, including `id`, `judge_id`, `team_id`, `criterion_id`,` value`, and `is_locked`. The `id` property is the unique identifier of the rating, while the `judge_id`, `team_id`, and `criterion_id` properties identify the judge, team, and criterion, respectively. The `value` property represents the rating value given by the judge, and the `is_locked` property indicates whether the rating can still be changed.

The class contains a constructor method that retrieves the rating data from the database based on the `id` parameter passed to the constructor. The class also has a method for finding a rating by its `id`, as well as a method for checking if a rating with a given `id` exists.

The class has a method for checking if a rating for a given judge, team, and criterion already exists in the database. The class also has a method for inserting a new rating into the database, which first checks if the rating already exists and if the judge, team, and criterion are valid.

The `toArray()` method is used to convert the rating object to an associative array.

The `Rating` class depends on other classes, such as `Judge`, `Team`, and `Criterion`, which are also included in the script.
