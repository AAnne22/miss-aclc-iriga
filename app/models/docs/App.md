# App Class

This is a PHP class named `App` that can be used as a base class for creating web applications. It includes some useful methods that can be used in various parts of the application.

### Constructors 

The constructor of the `App` class initializes a database connection if it exists. If the connection is not available, it calls the `returnError` method to display an HTTP error message

### returnError Method

The `returnError` method is a static method that can be used to return an HTTP error message. It takes two parameters: `$header`, which is the HTTP header to be returned, and `$error`, which is the error message to be displayed. This method is useful for handling errors in the application.

### generateSlug Method

The `generateSlug` method is a static method that can be used to generate a slug from a string. It takes a string as input and returns a slug that can be used in URLs. The method converts the string to lowercase, replaces any non-alphanumeric characters with hyphens, and removes any leading or trailing hyphens.

### Conclusion

The `App` class is a useful base class for creating web applications. It includes some helpful methods that can be used in various parts of the application. The `returnError` method is especially useful for handling errors, while the `generateSlug` method is useful for generating slugs that can be used in URLs.
