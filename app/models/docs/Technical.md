This is a PHP code that defines a class named "Technical" that extends the "User" class. The "Technical" class represents a technical user in a system, and it has methods for finding, inserting, and updating technical users in a database.

### The "Technical" class has the following properties:

- `$table_events`: a protected property that stores the name of the database table used to store technical events.
- The constructor takes two parameters, the username and the password, and it calls the constructor of the parent "User" class with the "technical" role.
- The class has a private static method named "executeFind" that takes a prepared statement as a parameter, executes it, and returns a Technical object if a row is found in the result set, or false otherwise.
- The class has a public static method named "findById" that takes an ID as a parameter, prepares a SELECT statement that retrieves the username and password of the technical user with the given ID from the database table, binds the ID parameter to the prepared statement, and calls the "executeFind" method with the prepared statement to retrieve the technical user object or false.
- The class has a public method named "toArray" that takes an optional array of properties to append to the result array and calls the parent "User" class's "toArray" method.
- The class has a public static method named "all" that retrieves all technical users from the database table, creates a Technical object for each row, and returns an array of Technical objects.
- The class has a public static method named "rows" that calls the "all" method, loops through the Technical objects, calls the "toArray" method on each object, and returns an array of arrays.
- The class has a public static method named "exists" that takes an ID as a parameter, checks if the ID exists in the database table by calling the "findById" method, and returns a boolean value indicating whether the ID exists or not.
- The class has a public static method named "usernameExists" that takes a username and an optional ID as parameters, prepares a SELECT statement that retrieves the ID of the technical user with the given username and different from the given ID from the database table, binds the username and ID parameters to the prepared statement, executes it, and returns a boolean value indicating whether the username exists or not.
- The class has a public method named "insert" that checks if the ID and username already exist in the database table, checks if the username and password properties are set, prepares an INSERT statement that inserts the technical user properties into the database table, binds the properties to the prepared statement, executes it, and sets the ID property of the Technical object to the last insert ID.
- The class has a public method named "update" that checks if the ID exists in the database table, checks if the username and password properties are set, checks if the username exists in the database table for a different ID, prepares an UPDATE statement that updates the technical user properties in the database table, binds the properties to the prepared statement, and executes it.
